	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>
		I’m a designer, coder, and educator. Part of that work involves motion design — I’m teaching a course at RISD right now in the subject!
	</p>
	<p>
		But my love of motion design comes less from the design world, and more from the worlds of video games, film, and theater. And I’ve always loved it when things were moving — when they were animated, or in motion.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you just want to code, skip this demo. If you want to hear about my path toward becoming a designer, animator, and coder, keep reading!

	<h2>A glossary of my work and influences</h2>

	<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqjJzuaNSE" target="_blank">Klay World</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		Some of the earliest videos I ever watched were Robert Benfer’s Klay World videos. They were rough, crude, but also “real” works of art in a way.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3K3Q7z79fqiNnd3ck52SWx4MW8/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-vE8ubBKR2uC58V_ZxqZ0kQ" target="_blank">Claymation Buddies</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I wanted to be like Robert. So, I suffered through many crashes in Windows Movie Maker to create my own (even more) crude animation.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_game" target="_blank">Flash Games</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		At the same time, Flash games and animations dominated the web. Seemingly anyone could create work and share it with the world. These projects made me feel close to people I would never meet, like I was playing a game with them.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Zord/projects/" target="_blank">Scratch</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		A friend introduced me to Scratch — a programming language made for kids — and I became obsessed. I had tried to use Flash and really couldn’t wrap my head around code. But in Scratch, I could actually create interactive games and animations.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/a-low-hung-head/" target="_blank">A Low-Hung Head</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I just kept making things. I took my earlier experiments with stop motion animation and created a longer, narrative-driven film using paper cutouts.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		But this kind of work required music. So I began composing and releasing songs online.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Vl2ZcN91Ik_ncB67B4-HvVXpNOl28lK/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Tumblr</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		If I was making all this content, I wanted my own website, too. The easiest way to do that was by making a Tumblr account. It ended up becoming a film blog, with an overly confident “Hire me” button on it for some reason.
	</p>
	
	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/wesleyan-monogram/" target="_blank">Wesleyan University</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I went to college thinking I would study film. I tried to, and I hated it. So instead, I studied computer science (which I also hated) and theater (which I loved).
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/no-replica/" target="_blank">No Replica</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		My love for theater turned into a love for both theater posters and sound design. I had always wanted to create interactive experiences like Flash games, but found coding to be uninspiring. Theater gave me a creative outlet with fewer roadblocks. My undergraduate thesis was an exploration of these ideas.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/the-public-theater/story" target="_blank">Paula Scher</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I started confronting the idea of a so-called “career path.” Paula Scher’s work with The Public Theater in New York offered me some inspiration.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/24-hour-plays/" target="_blank">The 24 Hour Plays</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		An internship gave me the chance to put all of these random skills and experiences into practice. For no pay, I created something I was really proud of.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/williamstown-theatre-festival-2020/" target="_blank">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		Years of unpaid work did eventually pay off. I created a season of posters for Williamstown Theatre Festival and added my own animated, musical spin to them.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gabrieldrozdov.com/work/motion-experiments-2020/" target="_blank">COVID</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I worked in theater, and COVID ended all theater. So, I hunkered down and kept teaching myself motion skills.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://thisisforyou.gabrieldrozdov.com/" target="_blank">RISD</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		I built a portfolio that got me into RISD, which gave me an opportunity to refine my design practice.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://noreplica.com/" target="_blank">No Replica</a> (again!)</h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		Studying at RISD, I fell back in love with a different kind of theatrical, performative medium — websites. Websites let me create interactive, dynamic experiences that I could easily share with others. After graduating, I started a design studio named after my undergraduate thesis.
	</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gdwithgd.com/" target="_blank">GD with GD</a></h3>
	<p class="info-content-indent">
		That leads us to here and now — you’re on DEMOLAND, one of a variety of websites I create to teach all sorts of things like graphic design, animation, and web programming.

	<h2>Motion design for the web</h2>

	<p>
		That leads us to the workshop at hand: what role does motion design play on the web?
	</p>
	<p>
		To the right, you’ll find several ways I’ve tried to answer that question in my own work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you’re ready, continue to the next demo and learn how to code some web-based animations!

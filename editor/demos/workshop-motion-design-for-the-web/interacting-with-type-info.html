	<h2>Your Challenge</h2>
	<p>
		Find a variable font you want to use on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?categoryFilters=Technology:%2FTechnology%2FVariable" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>. Make sure to filter by variable only!
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, import your font into this demo. You can do that by pressing “Get font” in Google Fonts, then pressing “Get embed code,” and lastly copying the <span class="info-code">&lt;link...&gt;</span> embed code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to use your font in your file! Specify its name in the <span class="info-code">font-family</span> CSS property, and then use the <span class="info-code">font-variation-settings</span> property to create an animated link!

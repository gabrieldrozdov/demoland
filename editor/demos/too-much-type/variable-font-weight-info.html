		Variable Font Weight
	</h1>
	<p>
		If your font has a weight (wght) axis, you have to add one extra line of CSS. In the <span class="info-code">@font-face</span> rule, add a <span class="info-code">font-weight</span> line that includes 2 numbers: the font’s minimum weight, and its maximum weight. We have to do this because <span class="info-code">font-weight</span> is a special CSS property that predates variable fonts, and otherwise your font won’t render correctly in Safari.

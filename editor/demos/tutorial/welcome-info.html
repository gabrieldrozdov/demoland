	<h2>Writing Code</h2>
	<p>
		Write your code directly in the Editor panel. By default, code is interpreted as HTML.
	</p>
	<p>
		To write CSS, use the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element.
	</p>
	<p>
		To write JavaScript, use the <span class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> element.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your code will generate a live preview in the Preview panel. On the bottom of the Editor panel, you have controls to delay, pause, or refresh this preview.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Editor panel also features a console for testing your JavaScript code. This console is not a full substitute for your browser’s console, but still works in most cases.

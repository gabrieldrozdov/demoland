		What is HTML?
	</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the main programming language of the web. It organizes information using <strong>HTML elements</strong>, which are marked by opening and closing <strong>HTML tags</strong>. For example, a paragraph opens with <span class="info-code">&lt;p&gt;</span> and closes with <span class="info-code">&lt;/p&gt;</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The code in the Editor panel is all HTML. Notice how each HTML element gets interpreted by the browser in the Preview panel. HTML tags (colored red in the Editor panel) are not visible on a live website. The Editor panel (and any text editor) will automatically color your code to let you know if it contains any typos.
	</p>
	<p>
		By itself, HTML can’t do much other than organize information. To actually control the appearance of HTML elements, we’ll need to use CSS.

		What is CSS?
	</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a programming language that lets you control the appearance of HTML elements. Its code looks a little different than HTML (this is called its <strong>syntax</strong>), but youâ€™ll often find it right next to HTML.
	</p>
	<p>
		CSS consists of <strong>properties</strong> organized into <strong>classes</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Inline CSS</strong> lives directly inside of HTML tags via the <strong>style attribute</strong>. Alternatively, we can reuse CSS by writing classes inside the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element, which we typically place at the top of our document. In either case, the Editor panel will interpret your code as CSS, not HTML.

		Using the Inspect Tool
	</h1>
	<p>
		Web browsers have helpful tools built in to analyze and debug websites. One of those tools is the <strong>inspect tool</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please use Google Chrome for this demo!
	</p>
	<p>
		Shortcuts:
		MacOS: COMMAND+OPTION+C<br>
		Windows: CONTROL+SHIFT+C<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also right-click anywhere on a page and then click “Inspect”.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once in the inspect tool, click the button in the top-left (it looks like a square with an arrow pointing at the center). This tool lets you highlight elements on a page to see their properties.
	</p>
	<p>
		With an element highlighted, view the “Styles” and “Computed” tabs to see what CSS is applying to that element!

		Randomizing Variable Axis Values
	</h1>
	<p>
		With a little bit of math, we can get ourselves a random number for our variable axes!
	</p>
	<p>
		This process starts by using the <span class="info-code">Math.random()</span> function. This gets us a number between 0â€“1 (as a decimal).
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, we need to convert that number to the proper range of variable axis values. If our minimum is 0, then we just need to multiply this number by the maximum value, like 100 in this case.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we need the appropriate amount of decimal units for our variable axis. We can round to the nearest integer by using the <span class="info-code">Math.round(_)</span> function.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few more tips:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you always want to round down, use <span class="info-code">Math.floor(_)</span>.</li>
		<li>If you always want to round up, use <span class="info-code">Math.ceil(_)</span>.</li>
		<li>If you want to truncate to a specific number of decimal points, use <span class="info-code">_.toFixed(2)</span>, where you can change 2 to the number of digits after the decimal you want to keep. For example, <span class="info-code">(0.9876).toFixed(2) = 0.98</span>.</li>
	</ul>

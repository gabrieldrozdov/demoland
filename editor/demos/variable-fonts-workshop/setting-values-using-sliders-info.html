		Setting Values Using Sliders
	</h1>
	<p>
		Sliders let us predefine a range of values that we can then use to set variable axis values, as well as other CSS properties. We can create a slider using <span class="info-code">&lt;input type="range" min="_" max="_" value="_"&gt;</span>, where “min” is the minimum value, “max” is the maximum value, and “value” is the default value.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the <span class="info-code">oninput="_"</span> event, we can run a function every time the slider gets changed. In this case, we have a function for each slider. These functions update the corresponding CSS variable, which updates our live text.

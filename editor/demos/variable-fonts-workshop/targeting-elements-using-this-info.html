		<span>Type as Pattern</span>
		Targeting Elements Using “this”
	</h1>
	<p>
		We used <span class="info-code">onclick="_"</span> in the last demo. There are a variety of similar HTML attributes to call JavaScript functions, called <strong>events</strong>. <a href="" target="_blank">Here’s a list of the events you can use.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		In this demo, we use the <span class="info-code">onmouseenter="_"</span> event. This calls a function with an <strong>argument</strong>, which we put inside of the parentheses () when we call the function. Arguments can be a variety of things, and in this case we’re using an argument called “<strong>this</strong>”.
	</p>
	<p>
		The “this” argument lets us use JavaScript to change the element we just interacted with. In this case, our function <span class="info-code">toggleMyVariableClass(_)</span> features the text “myElement” inside its parentheses. That lets us refer to that element inside our code just like in the previous demo. We can then toggle a CSS class such as the class “hidden” as featured here.

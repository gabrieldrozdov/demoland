<body>
	
	<p>
		By default, most elements are block-level elements, meaning they take up the full width of their parent element. One inline-level element is the <span style="color: red;">span</span> element.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, any element can be set to block or inline using the display property!
	</p>

	<p style="display: inline;">
		Here is an inline paragraph.
	</p>

	<p style="display: inline;">
		And another inline paragraph!
	</p>

	<span style="display: block;">
		And here is a block-level span tag!
	</span>

	<p>
		Inline elements have some funny behaviors. <span style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">Here’s what happens when you apply padding and a border to an inline element.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		We can also create inline-block elements which have slightly different behavior. <span style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">Here’s a span tag turned into an inline-block element.</span> Notice how the border no longer overlaps the other text, and try to resize the page to see how the text looks when it wraps to another line.
	</p>

	<p>
		Lastly, the display property can be used to make something disappear. <span style="display: none;">Like this!</span>
	</p>

		<span>The Box Model</span>
		Box Sizing
	</h1>
	<p>
		The <span class="info-code">box-sizing</span> property affects how width is calculated. By default, an element’s padding and border are not included in its overall width. That means that setting an element to a width of 100% causes it to overflow its container.
	</p>
	<p>
		To fix this, we can use <span class="info-code">box-sizing: border-box</span>. Easy!
	</p>
	<p>
		Why is this not the default setting? Long story short, the Internet is old. This is how it was originally built, and nowadays we don’t want to break how old websites work, so we have to override their default settings.

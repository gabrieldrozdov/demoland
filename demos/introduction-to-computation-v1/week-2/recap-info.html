<h1>
	<span>Week 2</span>
	Recap
</h1>

<p>
	Last week, we played around with HTML and CSS, exploring how designing with code is different from traditional design. We went pretty far, but we’re going to pivot to JavaScript this week. So here’s what you should remember from that class for now:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML elements have opening and closing tags</li>
	<li>CSS works by combining properties with values</li>
	<li>We write CSS in the &lt;style&gt; element</li>
	<li>We can combine multiple CSS styles in a class, indicated by a period followed by a name and curly brackets</li>
	<li>We connect CSS classes with HTML elements using the class attribute, which lives inside of an element’s opening tag</li>
</ul>

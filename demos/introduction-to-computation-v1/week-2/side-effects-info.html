	Side effects
</h1>

<p>
	We often write functions that don’t return a value. When a function does something that it doesn’t return, it’s called a <strong>side effect</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, we are simulating a bank where you can deposit money, withdraw money, and check your account balance. None of these functions return anything. Instead, they change the value of a variable, <span class="info-code">myMoney</span>. The third function logs a string to the console, but it still doesn’t return anything.

<h1>
	<span>Week 2</span>
	HTML template
</h1>

<p>
	Our demos so far have been a little simplified. Let’s make them a more realistic by using a proper <strong>HTML template</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	This demo features some new concepts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>We have new <strong>meta elements</strong> that help a web browser render our page.</li>
	<li>The <span class="info-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> element contains things like the title of our site (which appears in the browser tab) as well as our CSS, which goes inside the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element.</li>
	<li>The <span class="info-code">&lt;body&gt;</span> element contains contains our visible content as well as our JavaScript, which goes inside the <span class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> element.</li>
	<li>There are three different ways to write <strong>comments</strong>, which are invisible code descriptions. The notation depends on which language/syntax you’re following (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Most demos will use this template from now on.

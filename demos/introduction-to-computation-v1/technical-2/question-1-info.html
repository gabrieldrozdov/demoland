<h2>
	About this demo
</h2>

<p>
	This demo features a button. When the button is clicked, a function called <span class="info-code">generateRandomNumber</span> runs and causes an <span class="info-code">alert</span> reading “TODO” to appear.
</p>

<h2>
	Your task
</h2>

<p>
	Edit the function so that instead it triggers an <span class="info-code">alert</span> that gives a random rounded number (an integer) between -485 and 213.

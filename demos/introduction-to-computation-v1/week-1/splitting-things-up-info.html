	The last demo was pretty boring. While it was technically an HTML file, it wasn’t doing anything special. To do anything cool with HTML, we need to start creating <strong>HTML elements</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	The most basic HTML element is the <span class="info-code">&lt;div&gt;</span>. Almost every HTML element is indicated by an opening and closing tag, so to create a div we need to start with <span class="info-code">&lt;div&gt;</span> and end with <span class="info-code">&lt;/div&gt;</span>.
</p>

<p>
	But this is still BORING. To make our code interesting, we’ll need to start using a different programming language in combination with HTML. That language is <strong>CSS</strong>, and it controls the styling of HTML elements.

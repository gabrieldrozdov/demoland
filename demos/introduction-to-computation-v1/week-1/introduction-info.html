<p>
	Code is just a file of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text" target="_blank">plain text</a> — an unformatted text document that doesn’t contain styling information (like fonts or colors).
</p>

<p>
	We can tell the <strong>programming language</strong> for a plain text file by looking at its file extension (the part of the file name after the period, like how “.pdf” indicates a PDF file). When you load a website, you’re accessing the site’s <strong>HTML</strong> file, which ends with a “.html” extension. On DEMOLAND, every demo is an HTML (or .html) file — you can prove it by downloading this file in the bottom-right corner!

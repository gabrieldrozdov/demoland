		<h1>This is a mother🦆ing website.</h1>
		<p>And it's 🦆ing perfect.</p>
			
		<h2>Seriously, what the 🦆 else do you want?</h2>
		<p>You probably build websites and think your 💩 is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some 🦆ing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a 🦴r because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, mother🦆er. Let me describe your perfect-🫏 website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>💩's lightweight and loads fast</li>
			<li>Fits on all your 💩ty screens</li>
			<li>Looks the same in all your 💩ty browsers</li>
			<li>The mother🦆er's accessible to every 🫏hole that visits your site</li>
			<li>💩's legible and gets your 🦆ing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Well guess what, mother🦆er:</h3>
		<p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this 💩. It's a mother🦆ing website. Why the 🦆 do you need to animate a 🦆ing trendy-🫏 banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of 💩? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your 🦆ing site, and some mother🦆er jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that 💩. Not to mention blind people will never see that 💩, but they don't see any of your 💩ty 💩.</p>
		<p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
		
		<h2>It's 🦆ing lightweight</h2>
		<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your 🦆ing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the 🦆ing background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a 💩ty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of 💩.</p>
		
		<h2>It's responsive</h2>
		<p>You dumb🫏. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever mother🦆ing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a mother🦆ing Tamagotchi.</p>
		
		<h2>It 🦆ing works</h2>
		<p>Look at this 💩. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, mother🦆er. It makes sense. It has mother🦆ing hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your 🐶-🫏 browser know what the 🦆's in this 🦆ing site. That's semantics, mother🦆er.</p>
		
		<p>It has content on the 🦆ing screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
		
		<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this mother🦆er in IE6. I 🦆ing dare you.</p>
		
		<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
		<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no 🦆ing idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are 💩ty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a 🦆ing message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's 🦆ing beautiful.</p>
		<h3>Yes, this is 🦆ing satire, you 🦆</h3>
		<p>I'm not actually saying your 💩ty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-🐶.</p>

	Looping through arrays
</h1>

<p>
	We can use our knowledge of array indexing to loop through arrays automatically. Here are three common methods for doing so:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using a <span class="info-code">while</span> loop and a variable that keeps track of the current index</li>
	<li>Using a <span class="info-code">for</span> loop that does the same thing</li>
	<li>Or, using a <strong class="info-code">for...of</strong> loop, that lets us reference the contents of our array directly</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The advantage of using a <span class="info-code">for...of</span> loop is that our code is much simpler, but we donâ€™t automatically have an index number we can reference.

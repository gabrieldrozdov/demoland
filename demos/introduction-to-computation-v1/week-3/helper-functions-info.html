	Helper functions
</h1>

<p>
	It’s often useful to have secondary functions that help our main functions run. These are functions that complete intermediary steps before we return or output our final result. We call these secondary functions <strong>helper functions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	In this demo, we’re using a helper function to randomize (or <strong>shuffle</strong>) an array. I didn’t write this function myself and instead found it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Some helper functions are built-in to JavaScript. For example, if you have an array of numbers <span class="info-code">myNumbers</span>, you can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort" target="_blank">sort</a> that array by saying <span class="info-code">myNumbers.sort()</span>. Another example is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim" target="_blank">trim</a> function, which removes spaces at the start and end of a string.

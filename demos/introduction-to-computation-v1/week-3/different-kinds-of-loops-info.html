<h1>
	<span>For Loops</span>
	Different kinds of loops
</h1>

<p>
	The previous demos used <span class="info-code">while</span> loops. <strong class="info-code">for</strong> loops are an alternative kind of loop we can also use.
</p>

<p>
	<span class="info-code">for</span> loops use a similar construction as <span class="info-code">while</span> loops. Except, the condition (i.e. the text within the parentheses) has three distinct statements separated by a semicolon:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Initialization for a loop counter variable</li>
	<li>Condition that gets evaluated each time the loop runs</li>
	<li>How the counter changes each loop</li>
</ol>

<p>
	<span class="info-code">for</span> loops can be easier to keep track of than <span class="info-code">while</span> loops because they contain all the information they need in a single line.

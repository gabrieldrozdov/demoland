		If you include a font file in your website’s repository, you can link it directly. Or, you can link a file from the Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have your font file, you can use the @font-face CSS rule to define the name and file source for your font.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example, I’ve included a font from Too Much Type, a font from Google Fonts, and a local font hosted on this website.

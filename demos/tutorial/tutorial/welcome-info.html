<h1>Welcome to DEMOLAND!</h1>
<p>
	<strong>DEMOLAND</strong> is a like a bookstore, except instead of reading books, you’re reading code! This site features <strong>demos</strong> that’ll teach you how to code websites using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Writing Code</h2>
<p>
	All demos on DEMOLAND use the web’s three main programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By default, the editor interprets all code as HTML, but we can add CSS and JavaScript inside of an HTML file.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is used to organize <strong>content</strong>, like text or images.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is used to <strong>style</strong> that content.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>JavaScript (or JS)</strong> is used to add deeper <strong>functionality</strong> to websites. 
</p>
<p>
	The next few demos in this chapter showcase how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript use different <strong>syntax</strong>. “Syntax” is the set of rules you need to follow when coding in a specific programming language. Open the next demo in this chapter to learn more about HTML!
</p>
<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
	Here are a few helpful shortcuts for when you’re editing code:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Command+]</code> and <code>Command+[</code>, or <code>Control+]</code> and <code>Control+[</code> to <strong>indent/outdent</strong> the selected lines of code.</li>
	<li><code>Command+/</code> or <code>Control+/</code> to <strong>comment in/out</strong> the selected lines of code.</li>
	<li><code>Control+Space</code> to bring up an <strong>auto-complete dialog</strong>.</li>

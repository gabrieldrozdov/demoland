<h1>
	What is JavaScript?
</h1>
<p>
	While HTML and CSS let us organize and style content, <strong>JavaScript (or JS)</strong> gives our site deeper interactivity and functionality. This functionality has a wide range of possibilities, from creating basic text pop-ups (like the one featured in this demo) to much more complicated interactions (like this entire site’s interface and code editor).
</p>
<p>
	JavaScript is very different from HTML/CSS and works more like a traditional programming language. That means that what you code in JavaScript is also possible in virtually any other programming language, while the same isn’t true for HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p>
	A warning: be sure not to confuse JavaScript with Java, which is an entirely unrelated programming language! Java was very popular, so the creator of JavaScript named it after Java to try to capitalize on that popularity.

<h2>
	Coding in JS
</h2>
<p>
	We write JavaScript inside of the <span class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> element, which we typically place at the bottom of our document.
</p>
<p>
	While websites will often run fine even if there are a couple of typos in our HTML and CSS, JavaScript is much more finicky and can easily break a site if it contains typos.

<h2>
	Functions
</h2>
<p>
	JavaScript can get pretty complicated, but generally speaking it involves creating <strong>functions</strong> that do stuff.
</p>
<p>
	Once we create a function, we need to run it! In this demo, we’re using the <code>onclick=" "</code> HTML attribute, which lets us run a JavaScript function when the element is clicked on. (This is called an <strong>inline event handler</strong>.) Try clicking on the button in the <strong style="color: var(--blue);">Preview</strong> panel and see what happens!

<h2>
	Adding (even) more functionality!
</h2>
<p>
	It’s often the case that we need thousands of lines of JavaScript to achieve a specific kind of functionality. Luckily, people distribute reusable JavaScript functions in the form of <strong>libraries</strong>.

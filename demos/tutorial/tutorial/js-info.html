	What is JavaScript?
</h1>
<p>
	While HTML and CSS let us organize and style content, <strong>JavaScript (or JS)</strong> gives our site deeper functionality. This functionality has a wide range of possibilities, from creating basic text pop-ups (like the one featured in this demo) to much more complicated interactions (like this entire site’s interface and code editor).
</p>
<p>
	JavaScript is very different from HTML/CSS and works more like a traditional programming language. That means that what you code in JavaScript is also possible in virtually any other programming language, while the same isn’t true for HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p>
	We write JavaScript inside of the <span class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> element, which we typically place at the bottom of our document. We can also use <strong>inline event handlers</strong> inside of HTML elements to call JavaScript <strong>functions</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	A warning: be sure not to confuse JavaScript with Java, which is an entirely unrelated programming language! Java was very popular, so the creator of JavaScript named it after Java to try to capitalize on that popularity.

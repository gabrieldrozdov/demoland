	What is CSS?
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a programming language that lets you control the appearance (or “style”) of HTML elements. Its code looks a little different than HTML. These differences are called a programming language’s <strong>syntax</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	CSS consists of <strong>properties</strong> with <strong>values</strong> organized into <strong>classes</strong>. We can then apply those classes to HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
	We write CSS classes inside the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element, which we typically place at the top of our document. If our CSS is not inside of the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element, then the browser will interpret it as HTML and the website won’t render properly.
</p>
<p>
	Another way to write CSS is by writing <strong>inline CSS</strong>, which lives directly inside of HTML tags via the <span class="info-code">style="_"</span> <strong>attribute</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	HTML handles content and CSS handles design. To make a site fully interactive, we’ll need to use <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Open the next demo to learn about JavaScript!

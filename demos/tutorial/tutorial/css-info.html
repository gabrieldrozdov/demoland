<h1>
	What is CSS?
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a programming language that lets you control the appearance (or <strong>style</strong>) of HTML elements. Its code looks a little different than HTML. These differences are called a programming language’s <strong>syntax</strong>.

<h2>Coding in CSS</h2>
<p>
	We write CSS classes inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, which we typically place at the top of our document. If our CSS is not inside of the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, then the browser will interpret it as HTML and the website won’t render properly.

<h2>Properties, values, and classes</h2>
<p>
	CSS consists of <strong>properties</strong> with <strong>values</strong>. A property controls some aspect of what an element looks like, such as its font or color. We write the property name, followed by a <strong>colon <code>:</code></strong>. Then, we assign a value to that property, followed by a <strong>semi-colon <code>;</code></strong>.
</p>
	We organize these property-value pairs inside of <strong>classes</strong>. To create a class, we write a <strong>period <code>.</code></strong> and then a <strong>name</strong>, which cannot include any spaces.
</p>
<p>
	We then apply these classes to HTML elements by adding a <strong>class attribute</strong> inside of the element’s opening tag. This follows the format <code>class=" "</code>, where the class name goes inside of the quotes.
</p>
<p>
	We can also apply CSS to a specific HTML element using <strong>inline CSS</strong>. This makes use of the <code>style=" "</code> attribute, which allows us to write CSS properties and styles directly within the HTML element.

	Adding more functionality

	To add deeper interactivity and functionality to our website, we’ll need to use <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Open the next demo to learn about JavaScript!

<h1>
	This is a basic demo of HTML!
</h1>

<p>
	HTML is nifty! Here’s what it can do:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Organize information, like text or images</li>
	<li>Tell the web browser what kind of information something is, like a heading, paragraph, or list</li>
	<li>Provide metadata to a web browser for sharing your site (like the thumbnail you see when texting someone a URL)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Lines of HTML code can get pretty long. To make all of your code fit on the screen, click on the <strong>“wrap text” toggle</strong> at the bottom of the Editor panel.

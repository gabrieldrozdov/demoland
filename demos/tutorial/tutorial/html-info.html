	What is HTML?
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the main programming language of the web. It organizes information using <strong>HTML elements</strong>, which are marked by opening and closing <strong>HTML tags</strong>. For example, a paragraph opens with <span class="info-code">&lt;p&gt;</span> and closes with <span class="info-code">&lt;/p&gt;</span>.

	The code in the Editor panel to the right is all HTML. Web browsers interpret HTML code and turns it into real websites. For example, HTML tags (colored red in the Editor panel) are not visible on a live website. The Editor panel (and any modern text editor) will automatically color your code to let you know if it contains any typos.

	HTML only handles content, so to design (or “style”) that content we’ll need to use another programming language called <strong>CSS</strong>. Open the next demo to learn about CSS!

	What is HTML?
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the main programming language of the web. We use HTML to organize a website’s content, like its text, images, videos, etc.

<h2>Coding in HTML</h2>
<p>
	The code in the <strong style="color: var(--green);">Editor</strong> panel to the right is all HTML. Web browsers interpret HTML code and turns it into real websites. For example, HTML tags are not visible on a live website, which you can see in the <strong style="color: var(--blue);">Preview</strong> panel.
</p>
<p>
	We write code using <strong>plain text</strong>. That means that our code does not feature any styling information you’d normalling get in a document editor, like font, alignment, or color. Instead, the code is automatically assigned colors based to indicate if it is written correctly or contains typos.

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>
	When writing HTML, we create <strong>elements</strong>, which are marked by opening and closing <strong>tags</strong>. For example, a paragraph opens with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and closes with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.

<h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>
<p>
	HTML only handles content, so to design (or <strong>style</strong>) that content we’ll need to use another programming language called <strong>CSS</strong>. Open the next demo to learn about CSS!

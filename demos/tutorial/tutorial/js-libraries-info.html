		What are JavaScript Libraries?
	</h1>
	<p>
		JavaScript can get pretty complicated. Sometimes, implementing a feature using JavaScript can require tens of thousands of lines of code. Luckily, thereâ€™s a long history of developers working for the greater good of the community and releasing complicated coding projects for free.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>JavaScript Libraries</strong> are a way for developers to release their code for others to use. In many cases, JavaScript libraries give us new functions to simplify tasks that would otherwise be extremely difficult or tedious.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can include a JavaScript library in our site by giving the <span class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</span> element the <span class="info-code">src="_"</span> attribute and specifying a URL that links to the library we want to use. We typically put this element at the top of our document. We can either download the library and include it in the files for our website, or embed it via a <strong>Content Delivery Network (CDN)</strong> link.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, this demo features <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, which is a library used for generating graphics on the web. You can see the code that runs p5.js by accessing its CDN link <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.10.0/p5.min.js" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
	We used <code>onclick="_"</code> in the last demo. There are a variety of similar HTML attributes to call JavaScript functions, called <strong>events</strong>. <a href="" target="_blank">Here’s a list of the events you can use.</a>
</p>
<p>
	In this demo, we use the <code>onmouseenter="_"</code> event. This calls a function with an <strong>argument</strong>, which we put inside of the parentheses () when we call the function. Arguments can be a variety of things, and in this case we’re using an argument called “<strong>this</strong>”.
</p>
<p>
	The “this” argument lets us use JavaScript to change the element we just interacted with. In this case, our function <code>toggleMyVariableClass(_)</code> features the text “myElement” inside its parentheses. That lets us refer to that element inside our code just like in the previous demo. We can then toggle a CSS class such as the class “hidden” as featured here.

<p>
	If your font has a weight (wght) axis, you have to add one extra line of CSS. In the <code>@font-face</code> rule, add a <code>font-weight</code> line that includes 2 numbers: the font’s minimum weight, and its maximum weight. We have to do this because <code>font-weight</code> is a special CSS property that predates variable fonts, and otherwise your font won’t render correctly in Safari.

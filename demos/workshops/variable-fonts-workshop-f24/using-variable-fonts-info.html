	Variable fonts often have unique axes, which have to be manually specified in the <code>font-variation-settings</code> property. To find your font’s axes, try testing it on <a href="https://fontgauntlet.com" target="_blank">fontgauntlet.com</a>! Once you know the names and ranges of your variable axes, you can define any values within that range.

	We can manually set variable axis values at any point using <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags and inline CSS. Be careful though — you might have to switch to single or double quotes ( ' or " ) to avoid breaking your code! These punctuation marks work basically the same way as each other. If you start with <code>style="_"</code>, then your interior quote marks should be single ( ' ) quotes.

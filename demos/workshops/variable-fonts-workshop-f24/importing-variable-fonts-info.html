	Variable fonts are incredibly useful tools for web developers. This demo features the basic importing process for using a variable font on your website.
</p>
<p>
	Use the <code>@font-face</code> rule to import your font like any other font. In most cases, you’ll want to use a local file path based on the file structure in your website’s repository. For instance, if your font is stored in a “fonts” folder, the code might be <code>src: url("fonts/my-font-name.ttf")</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Once imported, you can use the <code>font-variation-settings</code> property to set the value of your font’s variable axes.

	We can make the text inside your HTML element editable by using the argument <code>contenteditable="plaintext-only"</code>. This lets the user click and type inside of the element. The “plaintext-only” portion prevents the user from copy-pasting pre-formatted content into your element.

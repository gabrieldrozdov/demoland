For many programming languages, line breaks are not essential (but they are super helpful).

HTML doesn’t care about line breaks. Notice how the preview on the right doesn’t feature any line breaks, despite the editor having line breaks.

Press the “WRAP” button on the bottom of the editor to make the code fit on the screen.

HTML just cares about <strong>opening and closing tags.</strong> These tags indicate <strong>HTML elements</strong>, which contain different kinds of content.

<p>Here is a paragraph! Notice how paragraphs break onto a new line of text. That’s because paragraphs are <strong>block-level elements</strong>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we use the <strong>strong</strong> element to bold text. That doesn’t break onto a new line of text. That’s because strong elements are <strong>inline elements</strong>.</p>

<h1>Some HTML elements look different than others. This is a heading, specifically the Heading 1 element. There are 6 heading elements.</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<div>
	The div element is a generic block-level element, and the <span>span</span> element is the generic inline element.
</div>

<p>
	HTML doesn’t even care if the opening and closing tags for an element are on the same line as its content.
</p>

<p>


	Just make sure you don’t forget to put a closing tag for any opening tag!



</p>

<p>
	If we wanted to make some ASCII art, which requires multiple spaces in a single line, we’d need to use the <strong>pre</strong> element for preformatted text.
</p>

<pre>
	_.---._    /\\
    ./'       "--`\//
  ./              o \
 /./\  )______   \__ \
./  / /\ \   | \ \  \ \
   / /  \ \  | |\ \  \7
    "     "    "  "    
</pre>

	You might be wondering, how is anyone supposed to know what HTML elements exist? There are two main sites people go to as references:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements" target="_blank">MDN</a>, which is run by the browser company Mozilla and is basically the official reference for all things web-related.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, which is just some random company that has become a semi-reliable web resource (and is usually easier than MDN to read).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	BUT, there’s one more resource! I made a website called <a href="https://cheatsheet.gdwithgd.com/html/" target="_blank">Cheatsheet</a> that lists out (almost) all the useful HTML elements and organizes them based on what they’re used for!

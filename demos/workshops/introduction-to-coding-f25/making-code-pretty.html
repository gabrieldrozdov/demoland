	HTML is not very useful by itself. We need to use <strong>CSS</strong> to actually start making things look interesting.
</p>

<p style="">
	We can apply CSS to an HTML element by adding the <strong>style attribute</strong> inside of the opening tag of the element. This is called <strong>inline CSS</strong>.
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
	We write CSS by first writing a <strong>property name</strong> followed by a <strong>value</strong>. So, the property here is “color” and the value is “red” (a default CSS color).
</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-family: sans-serif;">
	If we want to apply multiple CSS properties to an element, we have to separate them via semi-colons.
</p>

<p style="max-width: 400px; transform: skew(-30deg);">
	By default, HTML elements are going to keep being added to the bottom of the page and stretch the full width of the page. We can use CSS to change how they’re sized and laid out.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: auto; max-width: 400px;">
	We can push an element to the right side of the page by setting its left margin to “auto”.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 400px;">
	Combining left and right margin gives us a centered element.
</p>

	Just like with HTML elements, how is anyone supposed to know what CSS properties exist?

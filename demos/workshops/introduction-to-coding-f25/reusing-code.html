	The previous demo showed that code can get pretty messy pretty fast. Luckily, we can organize CSS separately from HTML so that it’s easier to tell the two apart.
</p>

<p>
	To add CSS to our site, let’s use the <strong>style</strong> element. This lets us apply CSS to every element of a particular type (and also separate our code onto multiple lines).
</p>

<style>
	p {
		font-family: sans-serif;
		font-size: 24px;
		line-height: 140%;
	}
</style>

<p class="my-first-class">
	But what if we only want to apply CSS to a couple of paragraphs and not every single one? Then, we can use <strong>CSS classes!</strong>
</p>

<p class="my-first-class">
	CSS class names start with a period and can’t have any spaces. If you use punctuation, you should only uses dashes/hyphens.
</p>

<style>
	.my-first-class {
		font-family: monospace;
		padding: 5px;
		border: 1px solid black;
	}
</style>

<p>
	Notice how we overrided the font-family property with our class. CSS will override other CSS if it’s more applied in a more <strong>specific</strong> way to an element. So, we applied CSS to ALL paragraph elements, and then applied a CSS class to <em>only a few</em> elements.
</p>

<p class="my-first-class" style="font-family: cursive;">
	So in order of specificity, this paragraph gets its CSS from all paragraphs, and then from its class, and then from its inline CSS.

		<span>Type as Tool</span>
		Manually Setting Values
	</h1>
	<p>
		Besides the “this” argument, we can also pass other kinds of information into JavaScript functions. In this demo, we pass two integers (numbers without decimal points) separated by a comma. We can then reference these integers in our function <span class="info-code">setVariableAxisValues()</span> by giving them names, in this case “newWeight” and “newSerif”.
	</p>
	<p>
		By passing these arguments into our function, we can manually set our HTML element’s variable axis values. We do this by targeting the element like in the previous demos, and then using <span class="info-code">_.style.fontVariationSettings = "_"</span>. This lets us define a value for a specific CSS property, in this case the <span class="info-code">font-variation-settings</span> property. Notice that when converting the property name to JavaScript, we remove all hyphens and capitalize every word except for the first one. This notation is called <strong>camelcase</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then, we have to set a new value for our CSS property. We do that here using something called a <strong>template literal</strong>, which is just a fancy name for everything inside the back tick marks (which look like this ` and are located at the top-left of your keyboard).
	</p>
	<p>
		Inside the template literal, we can use the notation <span class="info-code">${_}</span> to insert our variables into our code.
	</p>
	<p>
		This demo also features a “Reset” button, which calls a second function to reset the variable axes to predefined values. And for fun, there’s also a button to change the font’s color. You can change any CSS property using this technique, not just <span class="info-code">font-variation-settings</span>. Notice that when we set a value that’s not “this” and not an integer, we need to include it in quotes (this is called a <strong>string</strong>).

		Variable fonts are incredibly useful tools for web developers. This demo features the basic importing process for using a variable font on your website.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use the <span class="info-code">@font-face</span> rule to import your font like any other font. In most cases, you’ll want to use a local file path based on the file structure in your website’s repository. For instance, if your font is stored in a “fonts” folder, the code might be <span class="info-code">src: url("fonts/my-font-name.ttf")</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once imported, you can use the <span class="info-code">font-variation-settings</span> property to set the value of your font’s variable axes.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can make the text inside your HTML element editable by using the argument <span class="info-code">contenteditable="plaintext-only"</span>. This lets the user click and type inside of the element. The “plaintext-only” portion prevents the user from copy-pasting pre-formatted content into your element.

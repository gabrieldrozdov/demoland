	<strong>CSS</strong>, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is the programming language that styles HTML elements. You can think of HTML as content, and CSS as style.
</p>

<p>
	What makes two programming languages different? They use different <strong>syntax</strong>, which are the rules we have to follow when writing code in a particular language. HTML uses elements indicated by opening and closing tags. CSS using <strong>properties</strong> with <strong>values</strong>, organized into <strong>classes</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Since HTML and CSS work so closely together, we can actually embed CSS into an HTML document. We do that using the <span class="info-code">&lt;style&gt;</span> element. Everything within this element must follow CSS syntax.
</p>

<p>
	CSS syntax follows this format:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <strong>class name</strong> that starts with a period. Class names cannot contain spaces and should only contain hyphens or underscores (- or _) for punctuation.</li>
	<li><strong>Curly brackets</strong> indicating the contents of that class, i.e. {}</li>
	<li><strong>Property names</strong> followed by colons :</li>
	<li><strong>Values</strong> followed by semicolons ;</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We can then apply a CSS class to an HTML element via the HTML “class” <strong>attribute</strong>. Attributes live inside the opening tag for an HTML element and are followed by an equals (=) sign and quotes (" ") with the class name.

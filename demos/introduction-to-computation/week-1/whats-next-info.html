<p>
	The world of programming is huge. While the code we’ve looked at so far IS code, is also sort of isn’t. HTML and CSS are mostly about content and design — how do we make our code actually do things?
</p>

<p>
	Short answer: <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	We’re going to spend most of this class focusing on how to code using JavaScript in the context of web programming. But while HTML and CSS are really specific to the world of websites, JavaScript is a more general programming language. That means that if you learn JavaScript, you will gain the general knowledge to code in ANY programming language.

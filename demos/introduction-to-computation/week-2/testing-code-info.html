	DEMOLAND features a console that you can toggle via the bottom-left button in the Editor panel. Even so, you should get comfortable using your browser’s console. Here are the shortcuts to open the console:

<ul>
	<li>Shortcut for Mac: <strong>⌘ + ⌥ + J</strong></li>
	<li>Shortcut for Windows: <strong>Ctrl + Shift + J</strong></li>

	Making these tutorials. . . uh. . . fun?
</h2>
<p>
	I’m going to try to give you helpful examples with each tutorial, but learning how to code can still end up pretty dry. Here’s my idea to fix that:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Each week, you’ll be asked to split into groups of 2 (or 3 if needed).</li>
	<li>Each group gets to pick a name. This can be a few words long.</li>
	<li>Throughout the lecture, I’ll ask you questions that you can buzz in to answer. If you get the question right, you get a point. (I’ll also need a scorekeeper!)</li>
	<li>At the end of the class, the winning team’s name gets added to a semester-long <a href='https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=832ad9d51a1c9f6d&q=mad+libs&udm=2&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqel41a-glE2Uq9eJ_Bs7HiCAkGUxQKUdfWX2fUGrOLURZjx2Dg9F5SNSUdW1ZCOD7AG7Nsv0UwshEVQVL4ATq91IrFj51xSm4ELYaeMWa6JVc-VrYvJN7KGwgnBlfFx3oEQdnZ2FkAqCIWN2dLrcIMsGlSjq4g&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj63Ou0md2LAxX7mokEHTZpBjMQtKgLegQIGxAB#vhid=Hs5nRvE1BoWPOM&vssid=mosaic' target="_blank">Mad Libs</a>. You’re competing to see what this Mad Libs sentence ends up becoming.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	For example, let’s say that a group named “Big dog” wins this week’s challenge. Next week, a group named “goes for a walk” wins, making the Mad Libs “Big dog goes for a walk.” We keep going until the semester is over.
</p>
<p>
	Also, I’m going to embed a buzzer into each slide so that you can buzz in to answer questions.

	Functions
</h1>

<p>
	Functions let us write reusable code that can <strong>return</strong> a value based on an inputted value (or values), which we refer to as <strong>arguments</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Returning a value is like evaluating an expression. For example, <span class="info-code">1&nbsp;==&nbsp;2</span> evaluates to <span class="info-code">false</span>. Similarly, a function can return the value <span class="info-code">false</span>, or even something more complex like an array or object.

	Functions
</h1>

<p>
	Functions let us write reusable code that can <strong>return</strong> a value based on certain inputs, or <strong>arguments</strong>. Functions are also useful for changing the values of variables even when they don’t return said variables. When a function does something that it doesn’t return, it’s called a <strong>side effect</strong>.

<p>
	Write a function called isEvenOrOdd that takes a single parameter, num, and logs if the number is even or odd. Hint: you’ll want to use the modulo/remainder operator, %!

	Operators
</h1>

<p>
	Operators let us change the value of variables. There are a few categories of operators:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Arithmetic (mathematical) operators</li>
	<li>Comparison operators</li>
	<li>Logical operators</li>
</ul>

<h2>
	Micro challenge
</h2>
<p>
	Create an overly complicated expression consisting of at least 10 operators that evaluates to true in the end. Youâ€™ll want to make use of parentheses!

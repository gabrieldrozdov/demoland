	Scope
</h1>

<p>
	The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible and can be used. JavaScript has a few different scopes you should know:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>lobal</strong> scope, declared outside of any function or block</li>
	<li><strong>Function</strong> scope, declared inside a function</li>
	<li><strong>Block</strong> scope, declared inside a block (i.e. anything featuring curly brackets {} )</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Variables defined using <span class="info-code">var</span> ignore block scoping.

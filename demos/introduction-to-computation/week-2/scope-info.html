	Scope
</h1>

<p>
	The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible and can be used. JavaScript has a few different scopes you should know:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Global</strong> scope, declared outside of any function or block</li>
	<li><strong>Function</strong> scope, declared inside a function</li>
	<li><strong>Block</strong> scope, declared inside a block (i.e. anything featuring curly brackets <span class="info-code">{ }</span> )</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Any variable defined within a function or block is called a <strong>local</strong> variable.
</p>

<p>
	Variables defined using <span class="info-code">var</span> ignore block scoping. That means we can define global variables even in a function as long as we use <span class="info-code">var</span>.

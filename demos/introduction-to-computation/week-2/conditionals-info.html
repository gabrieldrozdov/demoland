	Conditionals
</h1>

<p>
	Conditionals check to see whether a condition is true or false. You might also see them referred to as <strong>if/else statements</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	You can string multiple conditionals together using <span class="info-code">else if</span>. Or, you can do without the <span class="info-code">else</span> part of the conditional entirely.
</p>

<p>
	A shorthand for conditionals is the <strong>ternary operator</strong>, which is the <span class="info-code">?</span> symbol. This lets you write if statements in a single line.

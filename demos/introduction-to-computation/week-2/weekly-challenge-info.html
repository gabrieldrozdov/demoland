	Weekly challenge
</h1>

<p>
	Each week, I’m going to end our tutorial with a tougher challenge that you’ll need to solve in your pair programming groups. This challenge will put together all of the concepts we learned during that class.
</p>

<h2>
	Today’s challenge: a bank account simulator
</h2>

<h3>
	Prompt
</h3>
<p class="info-content-indent">
	Your task is to create two functions that similate depositing and withdrawing money from a bank. Your functions should feature arguments for how much money you deposit or withdraw. You should use a variable to keep track of how much money you have. If you go below $0, your code should say you have no money left
</p>

<h3>
	Example:
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Start with $100</li>
	<li>Deposit $50</li>
	<li>Withdraw $100</li>
	<li>Withdraw $50</li>
	<li>Your code should log something like “You’re out of money!”</li>
</ul>

<h1>
	<span>JavaScript</span>
	The Document Object Model (DOM)
</h1>
<p>
	In fact, whenever we target an element using <span class="info-code">document.querySelector()</span>, we are actually targeting an object that represents each element on the website. This is called the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Once we’ve targeted an element, we can see all of its key-value pairs by using <strong class="info-code">console.dir()</strong>. You’ll have to open your browser’s console to see all of the object’s information — DEMOLAND can’t handle this (yet!).
</p>
<p>
	In your browser’s console, notice how the element’s object has key-value pairs for all the things we’ve learned in class. This includes classList, style, and way, way more. We can access all of these key-value pairs in the same way we’d do with any other object.

	Objects
</h1>
<p>
	The final data type worth knowing (for now) is <strong>objects</strong>. Objects are like arrays, but instead of accessing entries via an index, we use <strong>key-value pairs</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	We use curly brackets <span class="info-code">{}</span> to mark the start and end of an object. Then, we write a key in single or double quotes, followed by a colon <span class="info-code">:</span> followed by the value.
</p>
<p>
	To access values in an object, we say the name of our object and then the key name inside of square brackets. Try typing <span class="info-code">console.log(obj1['Platformer'])</span> and see what outputs.
</p>
<p>
	Alternatively, we can use a period to get the content inside an object. Try typing <span class="info-code">console.log(obj1.Platformer)</span>.

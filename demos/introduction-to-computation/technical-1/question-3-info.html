<p>
	The original code features a string that uses single quotes to mark the start and end of the string, AND uses an additional single quote in the word <span class="info-code">You're</span>. There are several possible ways to fix this. We can change the single quote inside the string to a typographer’s quote, like <span class="info-code">You’re</span>, or change the outer single quotes to double quotes, like <span class="info-code">"You're so cool!"</span>.

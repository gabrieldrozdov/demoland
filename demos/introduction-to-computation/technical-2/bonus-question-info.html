<h2>
	About this demo
</h2>

<p>
	This demo features a button. When the button is clicked, a function called <span class="info-code">readAllData</span> runs.
</p>

<p>
	The JavaScript portion of this demo features an array called <span class="info-code">myData</span>. This array contains 4 other arrays, each of which contains several strings. When the <span class="info-code">readAllData</span> function runs, it triggers 4 <span class="info-code">alert</span> messages. Each <span class="info-code">alert</span> contains the data from one of the sub-arrays of <span class="info-code">myData</span>.
</p>

<p>
	If that’s confusing, just click the button to see what happens!
</p>

<h2>
	Your task
</h2>

<p>
	Edit the function so that each string gets its own <span class="info-code">alert</span> message instead of being grouped into an array. For example, right now the <span class="info-code">alert</span> for the first sub-array looks like the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>red,green,blue</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We want it to look like this instead (3 separate <span class="info-code">alert</span> messages):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>red</li>
	<li>green</li>
	<li>blue</li>
</ul>

<p>
	To do this, you’ll want to make a <span class="info-code">for</span> loop inside of the pre-existing <span class="info-code">for</span> loop.

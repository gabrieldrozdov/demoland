<h2>
	About this demo
</h2>

<p>
	This demo features a range input element with the <span class="info-code">oninput</span> inline event handler. This causes a function to run whenever the slider is changed. In this case, the function that runs is called <span class="info-code">updateText</span>. This function currently logs some lines of text to the console just to prove that it is working every time you change the slider.
</p>

<h2>
	Your task
</h2>

<p>
	Edit the function the function so that it displays the current value of the slider inside of the <span class="info-code">&lt;div&gt;</span> element with <span class="info-code">id="text"</span>.
</p>

<p>
	You can delete the <span class="info-code">console.log()</span> lines when you write your code — they’re just there as placeholders.

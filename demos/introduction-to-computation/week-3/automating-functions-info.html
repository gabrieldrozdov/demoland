<h1>
	<span>setInterval</span>
	Automating functions
</h1>

<p>
	Both <span class="info-code">while</span> and <span class="info-code">for</span> loops run instantly. If we want to add some delay between loops and have them run automatically, we can use <strong class="info-code">setInterval</strong>. This takes two arguments: a function name, and a delay time (in milliseconds).

<h1>
	<span>While Loops</span>
	Repeating code with loops
</h1>

<p>
	JavaScript is capable of running a large amount of code instantenously. If we want to automatically run some code multiple times, we can use <strong>loops</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	In this demo, we have a <strong class="info-code">while</strong> loop. <span class="info-code">while</span> loops look like <span class="info-code">if</span> statements and similarly check if a condition is true. The loop keeps running the code inside of its curly brackets until the condition becomes false.
</p>

<p>
	We’ll frequently want to run a loop a certain number of times. To do that, we’ll want to create a variable we can use as a <strong>loop counter</strong>. In this demo, we have the variable <span class="info-code">flips</span> which we initialize with the value 0. Every time the loop runs, we increase <span class="info-code">flips</span> by 1. The loop stops running once <span class="info-code">flips</span> is greater than or equal to 10.
</p>

<p>
	Loops can be dangerous because it’s easy to end up in a state where the loop condition never becomes false. In this case, we end up with an <strong>infinite loop</strong>. Infinite loops will cause your code to break.

<h1>Organizing styles using CSS classes</h1>
<p>
	In the previous demo, we had to use inline CSS on every element to change the website’s design. If we wanted to change the font or color across all elements, we would need to update every element individually.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>CSS classes</strong> let us organize our CSS styles separately from our HTML.
</p>

<h2>Defining classes</h2>
<p>
	We write our CSS at the top of our HTML file in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element. Everything inside of this element will be interpretted as CSS, not HTML. This is called <strong>internal CSS</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Class names</h3>
<p>
	To indicate a class, we write a period <code>.</code> following by a class name. This name should be in lowercase and cannot use spaces or special symbols. If we want a class name with multiple words, we’d separate the words with hyphens <code>-</code>, for example <code>.highlighted-stanza</code>.
</p>

<h3>Adding properties</h3>
<p>
	After our class name, we write our CSS property-value pairs inside of curly brackets <code>{_blank}</code>.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Reminder: after every property-value pair, make sure you add a semicolon <code>;</code></em>
</p>

<h2>Using classes</h2>
<p>
	To assign a class to an HTML element, we use the <code>class="_"</code> attribute. You can assign multiple classes to an element by adding a space between the class names.
</p>
<p>
	<em>Note: there must only be one <code>class="_"</code> attribute per element.</em>

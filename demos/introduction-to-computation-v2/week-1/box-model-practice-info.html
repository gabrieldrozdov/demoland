<h2>Advanced CSS selectors</h2>
<p>
	So far, we’ve seen class, element (.), and id (#) selectors. There are dozens of selectors we can use, which you can find a full list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Selectors" target="_blank">on MDN</a>. Here are a couple of useful ones:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <code>*</code> selector applies CSS to every element.</li>
	<li>By writing two selectors, like <code>div &gt; div</code>, we can apply CSS to children of specific elements.</li>
	<li>We can target every other child using the <code>:nth-child(_)</code> selector. This selector supports a variety of equations beyond just even or odd.</li>
	<li>And, we can combine any of the above selectors together to make even more complex selectors.</li>
</ul>

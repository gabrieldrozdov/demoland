<h2>HTML entities</h2>
<p>
	If we want to write certain characters like the <code>&lt;</code> symbol, we have to use special codes called <strong>HTML entities</strong>. Otherwise, the web browser will interpret these symbols as the start of HTML elements. For example, we can write <code>&lt;</code> by saying <code>&amp;lt;</code> (which stands for “less than”).
</p>
<p>
	In this poem, we’re using the <strong>non-breaking space</strong> entity, which lets us write multiple spaces in a row.

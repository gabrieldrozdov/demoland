<h1>CSS inheritence</h1>
<p>
	We can <strong>nest</strong> HTML tags inside of other HTML tags.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Parents</strong> are the outer elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Children</strong> are the nested elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Siblings</strong> are elements at the same nesting level. In this demo, the paragraphs are all siblings of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Some CSS properties pass down from parents to children. This is called <strong>CSS inheritence</strong>, where the children <em>inherit</em> CSS properties from their parents.
</p>
<p>
	Not all properties are automatically inherited, but most properties relating to typography are inherited.

<h2>The <code>div</code> element</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes, we need a generic HTML element. Here’s why this might be the case:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To group other elements together.</li>
	<li>To create an element that doesn’t have a prescribed type of content.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In this demo, we use the generic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to group our stanzas together.

<h2>CSS comments</h2>
<p>
	We can add notes inside of our CSS code using <strong>CSS comments</strong>. Comments start with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>

<h1>HTML elements for typography</h1>
<p>
	When <strong>typesetting</strong> on the web, we use a few common elements that differentiate different kinds of text. Learn more about these elements <a href="https://cheatsheet.gdwithgd.com/html/#typography" target="_blank">on Cheatsheet</a>.

<h2>HTML comments</h2>
<p>
	We can add invisible annotations to our HTML code using <strong>HTML comments</strong>. We start a comment by writing <code>&lt;!--</code> and end a comment by writing <code>--&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
	You can quickly comment or uncomment highlighted text by pressing <code>COMMAND+/</code> on MacOS or <code>CONTROL+/</code> on Windows.
</p>

<h2>Block and inline elements</h2>
<p>
	Most elements take up the full width of the page and result in a line break, like paragraphs. These are called <strong>block-level elements</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Some elements live inside of other elements and just take up the space their content takes up, like emphasized (italicized) text. These are called <strong>inline elements</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Nesting</h2>
<p>
	We can put HTML elements inside of other HTML elements. This is called <strong>nesting</strong>. Nesting elements results in the following relationships:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Parents</strong> are the outer elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Children</strong> are the nested elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Siblings</strong> are elements at the same nesting level. In this demo, the <code>em</code> and other inline elements are siblings of each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>HTML attributes</h2>
<p>
	HTML attributes provide extra information to HTML elements.
</p>

<h3>Where to add attributes</h3>
<p>
	Attributes live inside the opening tag of an element. For example, a paragraph using the opening tag <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. We would add any attributes after the tag name <code>a</code> and before the <code>&gt;</code> symbol.
</p>

<h3>Formatting attributes</h3>
<p>
	Attributes use the format <code>name="_"</code>, where “name” is the name of the attribute. The formatting of text inside the quotes depends on what attribute we’re using.
</p>

<h3>The “href” and “target” attributes</h3>
<p>
	For link elements, the <code>href</code> attribute indicates the URL to navigate to.
</p>
<p>
	Adding <code>target="_blank"</code> makes that link open in a new tab when clicked.
</p>

<h3>Discovering attributes</h3>
<p>
	We’ll go over a few of the most commonly used attributes in the following demos. Generally speaking, most elements use the same few attributes except for a few that require special attributes.

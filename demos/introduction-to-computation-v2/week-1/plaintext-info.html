<h1>Plaintext files</h1>
<p>
	Code is just text. We store that text in <strong>plaintext</strong> files. These are files that contain text without formatting. That means this text has no prescribed fonts, colors, etc.
</p>

<h3>Programming languages</h3>
<p>
	Depending on what we’re coding, we have to select a <strong>programming language</strong>. When we’re making websites, we use three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
	When we save a plaintext file, we use the <strong>file extension</strong> to indicate what language we’re writing in. HTML uses the file extension <code>.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Try downloading this demo (the code in the “Editor” panel) by pressing the “Download Code” button in the bottom-right corner to see a <code>.html</code> file!
</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>
	Each programming language has a set of rules we need to follow so that a computer can understand what we’re writing. This is called the language’s <strong>syntax</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	The “Editor” panel to the right shows HTML code representing William Carlos Williams’ poem “<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45502/the-red-wheelbarrow" target="_blank">The Red Wheelbarrow</a>.” The “Preview” panel shows how this code will appear on a live website. Notice how HTML’s syntax ignores line breaks when interpreting code.
</p>
<p>
	To get proper line breaks, we’ll need to use <strong>HTML elements</strong>. Learn more about elements in the next demo!

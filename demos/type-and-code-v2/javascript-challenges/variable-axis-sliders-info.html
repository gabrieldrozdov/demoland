	Variable Axis Sliders
</h1>
<p>
	This demo uses CSS variables to make a functioning variable axis slider. Here’s how it works:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The sliders are preset with the variable axis value ranges. So, the weight axis goes from 100 to 900, and the serif axis goes from 0 to 100.</li>
	<li>When the sliders are changed, they run a function that takes three inputs. The first is the <strong>selector (like ".class" or "#id")</strong> for what element to target. The second is the <strong>variable name (like "--some-name")</strong> for the CSS variable to change. The third is the slider value itself to set that variable to.</li>
	<li>Then, it targets the element for the given selector and updates its CSS variable.</li>
</ol>

	Let’s put all of these ideas together!
</p>
<p>
	In this challenge, make the <code>rando</code> function do the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>50% of the time, the text should change to a random color.</li>
	<li>The other 50% of the time, the text should change to a random entry from the array.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Good luck, and refer to the previous demos for help!

	This is a basic demo of HTML!
</h1>

<p>
	HTML is nifty! Here’s what it can do:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Organize information, like text or images</li>
	<li>Tell the web browser what kind of information something is, like a heading, paragraph, or list</li>
	<li>Provide metadata to a web browser for sharing your site (like the thumbnail you see when texting someone a URL)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Lines of HTML code can get pretty long. To make all of your code fit on the screen, click on the <strong>line wrap toggle</strong> at the bottom of the Editor panel.
</p>

<!-- This is an HTML comment! -->
<!-- HTML comments help document what your code is doing -->

<p>
	HTML and many other programming languages don’t care about line breaks like in the way you’re used to.
	
	For example, why isn’t there a line break here???
	
	To add a line break, we need to use an HTML element.
	<br><br><br><br><br>
	Success! Notice that the br element doesn’t have a closing tag like the other HTML elements.
</p>

<p>
	HTML also hijacks some characters because it needs them to write code. For example, I can’t write a “less than” sign without creating a new element. So, I need to use what’s called an <strong>HTML entity</strong>. We can search for these online, but here’s the one for the less than sign &lt;
</p>

<p>
	We can put some information inside of HTML elements to give them more functionality. These are called <strong>HTML attributes</strong> and live inside the opening tag of HTML elements. For example, links use the &lt;a&gt; element and take an “href” attribute to decide what link to navigate to. You can also use the “target” attribute to control if the link opens in a new tab or not!

<h1>
	Putting It All Together
</h1>
<p>
	In class, we saw that we could type ! and then press enter in Visual Studio Code to get an HTML template. That template helps separate out the HTML and CSS portions of our document.
</p>
<p>
	The style element (where we write CSS classes) lives inside the <strong>head</strong> element. This element contains all the invisible <strong>metadata</strong> for our document.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, all our visible HTML elements (like typography) live inside the <strong>body</strong> element.
</p>
<p>
	In class, we’ll also look at how we can put our CSS in a separate document entirely to keep ourselves even more organized.

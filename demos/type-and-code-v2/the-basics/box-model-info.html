<h1>
	Box Model
</h1>
<p>
	The last thing worth knowing for now is called the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong>. This is the structure that determines how CSS styles HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
	Basically, every HTML element is a box, with several CSS properties controlling how that box looks and gets positionined on the page.

<h2>The * selector and the box-sizing property</h2>
<p>
	The <strong>* selector</strong> applies CSS to every single HTML element. There is a weird property called <strong>box-model</strong> whose default value messes up the <strong>width</strong> property. For literally every website I make, I set box-sizing for all elements to the value <strong>border-box</strong>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn about the box-sizing property!

<h2>The body element</h2>
<p>
	The <strong>body</strong> element is needed to style the color of your websiteâ€™s background. You should only have 1 body element per page, and all of your visible content should go inside of the element (so NOT your CSS classes!).
</p>

<h2>A note on margin</h2>
<p>
	Margin is weird, in that margins between elements will overlap on each other instead of adding up. So if two elements have a margin of 40px, then there will only be 40px of space between those elements (as opposed to 80px).

<h1>
	Inheritence
</h1>
<p>
	We often group HTML elements together, in most cases using the <strong>div</strong> element (which is like a generic HTML element). Any elements inside that group are called <strong>children</strong>, while the outer element is called the <strong>parent</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Children <strong>inherit</strong> many (not all) CSS styles from their parent. For example, the children paragraphs are both sans serif even though we just said for the parent to be sans-serif. That means the property was inherited! On the other hand, the parent has a border, while the children donâ€™t.

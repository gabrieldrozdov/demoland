<p>
	There’s a wide range of ways to use CSS depending on the context. Here’s a few more things you should know:
</p>

<h2>Multiple CSS classes</h2>
<p>
	You can apply multiple CSS classes to an element by adding a space between class names inside of the class attribute.
</p>

<h2>When to use inline CSS</h2>
<p>
	Inline CSS is useful for one-off styling. You can apply it inside of a paragraph or other text element using the &lt;span&gt; tag.
</p>
<p>
	Also, inline CSS will <strong>override</strong> CSS from classes.
</p>

<h2>Global CSS</h2>
<p>
	If you write a CSS class in the style element but don’t start with a period, then that CSS will actually apply to all <em>elements</em> with that name. So in this demo, we’re styling all li (list item) elements for example.

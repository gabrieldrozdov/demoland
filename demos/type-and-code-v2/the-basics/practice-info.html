<p>
	Here’s a demo to help you practice all of the concepts we’ve talked about so far. In the demo to the right, you’ll find some text from an article (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank">Dogs from Wikipedia</a>). Try to complete the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Organize the article contents using HTML elements.</li>
	<li>Add CSS classes to those elements to style them, using CSS properties for typography and the box model.</li>
	<li>Style specific sentences, words, or letters by adding span elements and using inline CSS.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Here are some helpful links:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://cheatsheet.gdwithgd.com/html/" target="_blank">All HTML elements worth knowing!</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://cheatsheet.gdwithgd.com/css/" target="_blank">All CSS properties worth knowing!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	In class, we’ll review all these topics and then introduce interaction, animation, and responsive styling. After that, we’ll cover advanced layouts using flexbox and grid (so no need to look at those sections on Cheatsheet yet!).

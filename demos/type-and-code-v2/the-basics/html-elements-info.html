	Let’s practice coding! Here’s a poem I found on <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56293/yellow-goblins" target="_blank">The Poetry Foundation</a>. Your job is to typeset this poem using HTML elements for typography.

	How can you learn which HTML elements exist? Well, I’ve made you a website to help you out! Check out <a href="https://cheatsheet.gdwithgd.com/html/#typography" target="_blank">this page</a> (specifically the Typography section) to find links explaining all the relevant HTML elements for typesetting text.

	Note: there is not much styling/design you can do with HTML alone! In the next demo, we’ll explore how to use CSS to style elements.

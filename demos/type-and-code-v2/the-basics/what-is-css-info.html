	What is CSS?
</h1>
<p>
	Here’s the poem typeset using the HTML elements from before. Except, I’ve added a couple of extra fun things. Notice that some elements have the <strong>HTML attribute “style”</strong>, followed by an = sign, quotes, and then some text inside of the quotes. This text is interpreted as <strong>CSS</strong>, which is the programming language we use to style HTML elements.
</p>
<p>
	CSS combines <strong>properties</strong> with <strong>values</strong>. Properties are the visual characteristics of HTML elements, like its font color. A value for font color could be a named color, hex code, rgb code, or hsl (hue saturation lightness) code like we see in this demo.
</p>
<p>
	Right now, we’re looking at what’s called <strong>inline CSS</strong> because it lives directly inside of each element. In the next demo, we’ll take a look at how to apply CSS using a more commonly-used method.

<p>
	To write CSS, we write the property followed be a <strong>colon (:)</strong> and then the value followed by a <strong>semi-colon (;)</strong>. We can even add multiple properties to the same element!

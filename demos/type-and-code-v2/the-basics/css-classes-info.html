<h1>
	CSS Classes
</h1>
<p>
	In many cases, we want to apply the same CSS to mulitple HTML elements. We can do that using <strong>CSS classes</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	We write CSS classes inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, which we typically place at the top of our document. If our CSS is not inside of the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, then the browser will interpret it as HTML and the website won’t render properly.
</p>
<p>
	To indicate a class in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, we write a <strong>period (.)</strong> followed by the class name (all lowercase, no spaces!) and then <strong>curly brackets {}</strong>. Inside the curly brackets, we can write our CSS properties and values, making sure to add a semi-colon (;) after each value.
</p>
<p>
	Classes also make it easier to separate our CSS from our HTML, so that our code is easier to read!

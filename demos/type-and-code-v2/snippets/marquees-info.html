<h1>
	Marquees
</h1>
<p>
	A marquee is made through a flexbox where the horizontal content is hidden, preventing overflow.
</p>
<p>
	Inside the flexbox, we have groups of elements that use a simple animation, moving to the left and then restarting abruptly.
</p>
<p>
	The trick is to have multiple repetitions of the exact same group over and over so that the marquee looks like it goes on forever, otherwise it might not span the entire page.
